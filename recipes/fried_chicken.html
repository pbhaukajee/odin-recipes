<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>
    4 pounds chicken parts, including medium chicken wings, thighs, and
    drumsticks
  </li>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
</ul>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Make the buttermilk soak: In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk with the
      salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the chicken and stir to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 2
      hours or refrigerate for 4 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large, resealable plastic bag, mix the flour with the onion powder,
      garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne; shake to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a rack on a baking sheet. Working with one piece at a time, remove the
      chicken from the buttermilk soak, letting the excess drip back into the
      bowl. Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, pressing so it adheres all
      over. Transfer the coated chicken to the rack and let stand for 30
      minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a deep skillet, heat 1 inch of the oil to 350°F. Set another rack over
      a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Fry the chicken in batches,
      maintaining the oil temperature at 315°F; turn once, until golden and an
      instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece
      registers 160°F, 15 to 18 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the chicken to the rack and let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
